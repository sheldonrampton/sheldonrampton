\subsection{Detailed Description}
Default simple \hyperlink{classview}{view} template to display a single comment.

Rather than doing anything with this particular template, it is more efficient to use a variant of the comment.tpl.php based upon the \hyperlink{classview}{view}, which will be named comment-view-VIEWNAME.tpl.php. This isn't actually a views template, which is why it's not used here, but is a template 'suggestion' given to the comment template, and is used exactly the same as any other variant of the comment template file, such as node-nodeTYPE.tpl.php
